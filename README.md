A basic recipe program utilizing the Recipe Puppy API (http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/) and urllib for Python

The program allows the user to put in ingredients they have and any search terms (both are optional), and returns a random recipe. If the user likes what they see, they can open the recipe in their browser.
